# Exercise 3 

Your program should read information from the file ShowIpRoute.txt (the file contains only output of “show ip route” and for each route presented in the file you need to print the output like):

*Protocol:*  
*Prefix:*  
*AD/Metric:*  
*Next-Hop:*  
*Last update:*  
*Outbound interface:*   

### Example: 

**for the line “D 10.67.10.0  [200/128] via 10.119.254.244 , 0:02:22, Ethernet2” you should print:**

Protocol: 	EIGRP  
Prefix: 	10.67.10.0  
AD/Metric: 200/128  
Next-Hop:	10.119.254.244  
Last Update:	0:02:22  
Outbound interface: Ethernet2  
 




*Example of ShowIpRoute.txt is also given in the Exercise 3 folder*
